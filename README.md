It's Nostalgia Bot!

Pining for your time in Thinkful's slack channels where the local friendly bot would duel you to the death over your preference for react or angular?

This is the bot for you!

You don't need to deploy it because it's already deployed and running on its intended Discord server, so don't worry about the instructions for doing so!

Also, this is is technically my first published python code and it uploads photos of corgis to Discord on demand. You're welcome.
